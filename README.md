<h1 align="center">Animated Form</h1>

<p align="center">Hi, this animated form was made following this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GykTLqODQuU">Rocketseat video</a></p>

<p>This page is a form with different animations, like a "no" animation when the user try to send the form with the empty fields, or the animation in the background with a lot of squares going up, down and rotating. Feel free to use it to study</p>
